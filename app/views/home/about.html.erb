      <h2> About College Cook </h2>

      <p>
        Living on your own for the first time can be incredibly daunting, I know it was for me. When college students first make the big move out of the comfort of home, they must learn to take care of themselves. This means cleaning, laundry, and of course, cooking. Learning how to cook can be just as difficult as learning about your major in class. Most college student buy groceries and ingredients that they know, love, and are comfotable with. However, just because the items are familiar, does not mean that the college cook knows how to put these together to make something delectable. We are giving the students the power of knowledge of cooking. Simply enter in the groceries/ingredients you would like to use, and then we'll give you a bunch of recipes that use those very same ingredients. Learn how to cook many different dishes all with the things you love to eat. Once you get comfortable with the different dishes, don't be afraid to branch out and find new meals. Go from a college cook to a home chef.
